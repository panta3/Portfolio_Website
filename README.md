# Portfolio Website

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a software developer. It is built with modern web technologies including React, Three.js, EmailJS, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Interactive 3D Elements**: Incorporates Three.js to add engaging, interactive 3D elements to the website.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with EmailJS, allowing visitors to send messages directly from the website without the need for a backend server.

## Live Demo
You can view the live version of the website at [https://aaravpant.com/](https://aaravpant.com/). This is hosted using Hostinger.
